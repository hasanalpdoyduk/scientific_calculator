## Usage

It can be used by using the number buttons on the calculator or by typing numbers in the calculation screen with the keyboard. The result of the previous calculation is written in the history result screen above the calculation area (ans), so calculations can be continued using the result of the previous calculation. As a result of the user making an incorrect entry or an incalculable calculation, the calculator writes "error" on the calculation screen.
